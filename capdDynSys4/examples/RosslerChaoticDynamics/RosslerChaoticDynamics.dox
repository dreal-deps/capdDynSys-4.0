/*! \page examples_RosslerChaoticDynamics Chaos in the Rossler system

Consider the Rossler system
\f[
x' =  -(y+z), \qquad
y' =  x + by,\qquad
z' =  b + z*(x-a)
\f]

This example is a complete proof of
\li the existence of an attractor \b A for the Rossler system with parameter values a=5.7, b=0.2.
\li the existence of an invariant set \b H inside this attractor on which the dynamics is chaotic.
 
Let us fix Poincare section \f$ \Pi = \{(x,y,z) : x=0 \wedge x'>0\} \f$ and let \f$ P \f$ be the associated Poincare map - see picture below.

The first assertion is proved by showing the existence of a trapping region for \f$ P \f$. Namely, we show that the set
\f[ 
  T = [-10.7,-2.3]\times[0.02,0.04]
\f] 
is mapped into itself by the Poincare map \f$ P \f$, i.e. \f$ P(T)\subset \mathrm{int} T \f$.

The existence of chaotic dynamics has been proved for the first time by Piotr Zgliczyński
\verbatim P. Zgliczyński,
Computer assisted proof of chaos in the Henon map and in the Rossler equations, 
Nonlinearity, 1997, Vol. 10, No. 1, 243--252
\endverbatim    
He introduced a new topological tool for proving the existence of periodic orbits and symbolic dynamics, named \b covering \b relations. 
These geometric conditions simply mean that the edges of a rectangle must be mapped by the function in a proper side of the other rectangle as presented on the picture below.

The source of the program can be found in the <tt>capd/capdDynSys4/examples/RosslerChaoticDynamics</tt> directory of the CAPD library. 
The program runs within less than \b half \b second on a laptop-type computer.
 
\attention This program requires C++11 compiler support, for instance gcc-4.8 or newer with -std=c++11 flag.
